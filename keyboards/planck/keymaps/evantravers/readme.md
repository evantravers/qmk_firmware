# Planck Layout

![planck layout image](https://i.imgur.com/SjlKUR3.png)

Mostly default, except a few new things:
- I removed the arrow keys in order to have matched modifiers in both hands.
- I moved enter down a key.
- I put esc behind a layer so that I could use ctrl under my pinky as I have
  become accustomed.
- I use a lot of readline shortcuts for enter, tab, up and down... and I have
  those mapped in Karabiner to work all over osx. I probably need to program
  them into the board at some point.

## Problems

- Current sketch layer makes me switch back and forth constantly

## TODO

- [/] Use ctrl-j for enter
- [/] Use ctrl-i for tab
- [ ] Work on Sketch/Design specific layer:
    - [list](http://sketchshortcuts.com/)
    - [map](https://v1.designcode.io/sketch-keyboard)
    - [X] It may be as simple as making the left cntrl be both CMD+Raise layer, then I can get to my zooms with one hand.
    - [X] I am using double tap for the zoom keys now... I like it!
    - [ ] needs to preferably be useable with a let's split: manipulation on left hand, movement/alignment in right hand, to match what my hands do.
        - Need to have a convenient move mode: arrow keys and modifiers... maybe some alignment stuff in the right hand.
    - [ ] RGB to highlight the new arrow keys and different macros? (https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/feature_rgblight.md)
- [ ] Use both spaces for return?
