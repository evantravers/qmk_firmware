# Planck Layout

![planck layout image](https://i.imgur.com/SjlKUR3.png)

Mostly default, except a few new things:
- I removed the arrow keys in order to have matched modifiers in both hands.
- I moved enter down a key.
- I put esc behind a layer so that I could use ctrl under my pinky as I have
  become accustomed.
- I use a lot of readline shortcuts for enter, tab, up and down... and I have
  those mapped in Karabiner to work all over osx. I probably need to program
  them into the board at some point.

## TODO

- [/] Use ctrl-j for enter
- [/] Use ctrl-i for tab
- [ ] Work on Sketch/Design specific layer:
    - [list](http://sketchshortcuts.com/)
    - [map](https://v1.designcode.io/sketch-keyboard)
    - Missing shortcuts:
        - CMD+1-3
        - Easy arrow keys in right hand, w/ access to modifiers
        - Maybe somehow access to the pin controls on the arrow keys?
- [ ] Use both spaces for return?
