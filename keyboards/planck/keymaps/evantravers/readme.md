# Planck Layout

![planck layout image](https://i.imgur.com/SjlKUR3.png)

Mostly default, except a few new things:
- I removed the arrow keys in order to have matched modifiers in both hands.
- I put esc behind a layer so that I could use ctrl under my pinky as I have
  become accustomed.

- [current layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/1bcd477effdc9d202ee865b4e2a0b153)

## TODO

- Use the layer buttons as enter keys?
- Readline Layer?:
    - [ ] Use ctrl-m for enter
    - [ ] Use ctrl-i for tab
- [ ] Work on Sketch/Design specific layer:
    - [list](http://sketchshortcuts.com/)
    - [map](https://v1.designcode.io/sketch-keyboard)
    - Missing shortcuts:
        - [X] CMD+1-3
        - Easy arrow keys in right hand, w/ access to modifiers
        - Maybe somehow access to the pin controls on the arrow keys?
